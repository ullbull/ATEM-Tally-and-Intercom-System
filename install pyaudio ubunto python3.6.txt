Had problems installing pyaudio on Ubuntu with Pyton3.6.

Think this solved it:
sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio &&
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev &&
sudo apt-get install python-all-dev

pip install wheel

then:
pip install pyaudio

Or maybee this aswell:
sudo apt-get install python3-dev
sudo apt install libpython3.6-dev

Got problems playing soud with PyAudio. This solved it:
